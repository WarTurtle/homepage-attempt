## Interests
Officially I'm an undergraduate at Utah State University working towards and Bachelor's of Science degree in Biology with an emphasis in Biology. (I must really like Biology \<*shrug*\>) I've been dabbling in work as an Undergraduate Researcher, specializing in Theoretical Ecology. I mainly think about what happens to the seeds after they fall. I also dabble with some experimental Ecology, namely assisting with Nutrient Network and Seedling competition experiments. In reality, I spend a lot of free time fiddling with computer code and reading Lord of the Rings. 

## [Cache Valley Simulator](https://warturtle.github.io/apocalypse-jt-fork/)
In the apocalypse-game repository is the current version of the Cache-Valley Simulator, a javascript-based browser game that simulates environmental challenges that facing community planners around the world. This game has served as a way for the members of the USU Bio Nerd Herd to learn javascript. By programming more of our ideas in javascript, we feel that our research will be able to reach a wider audience. Namely, anyone with a web-browser.

## [The Seedscape Ecology Group](http://seedscape.github.io/BeckmanLab/)

I've been working with Dr. Beckman in her lab since January of 2018. My focus has been on developing programmatic models that can represent the effects of seed predators and seed dispersers on populations of seeds. test test test
