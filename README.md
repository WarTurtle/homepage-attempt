## Interests
Officially I'm an undergraduate at Utah State University working towards and Bachelor's of Science degree in Biology with an emphasis in Biology. (I must really like Biology \<*shrug*\>) I've been dabbling in work as an Undergraduate Researcher, specializing in Theoretical Ecology. I mainly think about what happens to the seeds after they fall. I also dabble with some experimental Ecology, namely assisting with Nutrient Network and Seedling competition experiments. In reality, I spend a lot of free time fiddling with computer code and reading Lord of the Rings.
